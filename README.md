#TODO:
-TODO: now that it can query a model, a means of persistent conversation with the model.
-TODO: front end needed
-TODO: API potentially, to handle queries in a server/client format
-TODO: Web scraping - this thing needs the capacity to go poke the web for stuff
-TODO: Research methods of improving context clues, potentially having a _rolling_ history
-TODO: Need to create a better init prompt, but overall function seems to work
-TODO: Add tuning parameters to config, so they are no longer hard-coded.
